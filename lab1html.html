<h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</h1>
<h2>By William Shakespeare</h2>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? <br />
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate: <br />
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, <br />
    And summer's lease hath all too short a date; <br />
    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br />
    And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; <br />
    And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br />
    By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd; <br />
    But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br />
    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st; <br />
    Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, <br />
    When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st: <br />
       So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, <br />
       So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
