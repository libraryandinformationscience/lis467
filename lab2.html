<h1>Cucumber Psalm</h1>
<h2>By Lisa Bellamy</h2>

<p>Flourish, unwashed, unpeeled, bouncy boys;<br />
grow, citizen-workers, clothed in good dirt—<br />
dearest ones, I place my hope in you—<br />
your green is king, in my garden. Chopped, you are <em>cukes</em>,<br />
(my Wisconsin <em>mamma loschen</em>)—fluted, celebrated,<br />
bobbing in vinegar and dill; tastiest brine.<br />
Emperor Tiberius, whom Pliny the Elder called<br />
the gloomiest of men, enjoyed cucumbers every night<br />
with dinner—yes, an attempt to self-medicate depressions—<br />
but was his gloom depression or prophetic vision?<br />
Caligula succeeded Tiberius. Today, the sky is blue—<br />
so what. I cannot stop worrying about the republic.<br />
When a Roman woman wanted a child, she tied<br />
cucumbers about her waist; what, you ask,<br />
do I want? Regime change. I want a sister or three,<br />
subversive, fomenting coffee klatch, chatter,<br />
plots against fascists over our <em>Gurkensalat</em>,<br />
lopped, swished with sour cream—dearest cukes,<br />
delight, nourish, fortify me—I want insurrection.
